## TODO

- Languages chart for some reason gets moved when portuguese legend is toggled.
- Remove fill from charts. Use just thick line instead. Consequently, remove transparent colors and logic to set legend with full color.

- Replace chevron with a svg.
- Give transition and rotation to chevron.
- Add height transition to a absolute positioned div that covers the flags to give the smooth behavior.

- Charts stopped sharing the same row on width > 1024px
