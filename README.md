## Reminders

- [Why using this weird fold structure around public?](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory)

  - As a work around to have svgs visible while developing and in the deployed version.

## TODO

- white right side appearing on responsive small screens, apparently when the chart width gets bigger than the body.

- Show experiences as bullet
- Language options expansion pushes elements below downwards
